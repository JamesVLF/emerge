I used to feel overwhelmed by my emotions, pushing me to do one thing or another. Even the word "overwhelmed" insinuates that some outside wind blew me helplessly to do something. It can feel that way, but it's only a matter of perspective. It starts with a knowing of a potential for beauty in you. That's you, and you acknowledge that it's you. By consequence, you know that the "thing that overwhelms" is NOT you. And there began the process of becoming more and more of myself. Dark nights of the soul (resulting from my failures of decision) became the catalysts for greater alignment. The will to not betray myself grew stronger, more and more immovable over time. Why would I ever choose to move and become something that I don't want. I want to be me. Why would I not want to be me? 

Over many years, I found that compulsions that were once overwhelming seemed like a puff of air against my cheek. Poof and gone. No lingering, no pressure buildup. It's amazing. That's how it always was. There was always a choice; my relationship to every circumstance in my life and the choices that I made from those timepoints were every time 100% volitional. It was just a matter of focus and perspective, a momentum that was redirected toward something I wanted more. That's it. Then, it all just happens.

And that is what brought me here. To know that my response to every circumstance I'm in from moment to moment is entirely in my control is frightening only to the part of myself that waits for Santa, that doesn't want to grow up, that doesn't want to be responsible. But freedom is responsibility! Being responsible means anything you choose is possible--anything. And when you know that life is good, you fear nothing about this infinite potential. You want to immerse yourself always into that, become that which is yourself. And that is when the goodies get delivered for real!




The limitlessness of your potential is terrifying to you, because you feel like you can't control it, that it will swallow you whole, digest your very existence--the process that took 8 billion years to shape you wants to now gobble you up! The simple idea that you are 100% responsible for what you become and that there are no limits in what you choose to become is tantamount to death, isn't it? I
