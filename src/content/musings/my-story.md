Five years ago, I enrolled full-time
at a small community college in Redding, CA. I had spent the previous two
decades building a prosperous career in business development, solving problems
for finance and marketing teams at Fortune 50s. In many ways, this career was
extremely rewarding, and it catalyzed my development on several levels over the
years. Eventually, I reached a point where I simply outgrew what that path
could offer. I needed space, a step back to gain perspective and fully
understand how I had changed. As I had responded to previous crossroads
encountered in my life, I needed to re-explore who I was and what my purpose
should be. Getting out of the hustle-bustle of the NY/NJ area and into the
tranquil beauty of NorCal nature seemed like the perfect way to respect this
important life transition. The wildfires that tore through my town followed with an
encore of a global pandemic were not exactly what I had envisioned.
Nevertheless, those circumstances facilitated a decision—based on pure
intuition devoid of any logic whatsoever, by the way—to  to return to college to re-learn my sciences. My
brilliant plan was this: make a huge circle in my life path and return to where
I was at the age of 18.

 

To
sum up my experience from the age of 0-18: relatively high levels of emotional
and psychological discomfort. When I left my family behind to pursue science at
the age of 18, I lacked the psychological foundation to support things like
goals and meaningful relationships. The reality of my foundationless state hit
me square in the face while living with other students at college, but I didn’t
know what to do about it. Amid the consequent increasing inner turmoil, and
beneath the compensatory, “over-achiever” facade, a mysterious compulsion to
simply understand never left my awareness. In fact, in my earliest childhood
recollections, it was a part of me, like a lifeline of sorts, an optimism
that’s just part of my personality. But the pressure buildup of avoidance
eventually reached a crescendo during my 4th year, and all of the
foundationless goals I had been pursuing fell to the ground like dead leaves in
autumn. 

 

I
built myself in the years that followed. I didn’t read self-help books or
listen to Tony Robbins or anything like that. I learned by messing up and
reflecting on why. I simply wanted to understand, so I leaned into my dilemmas
and traumas. I tried to avoid them, but they were inevitable. And although the
points in my life when everything seemed to fall apart felt unbearable at the
time, they were the greatest gifts imaginable. They were the catalysts for my construction
process; and I suppose the optimism, which is often called “the conscience,”
was the raw material. Every 6 or 7 years, I would look back and marvel at my
transformation and how my circumstances—career performance, functional
stability, the people surrounding me, and the growing sense of connection, trust,
and love—had changed. However, I carried a lingering sense of shame and regret
for “throwing away” my academic opportunities; and I often wondered whether I
had failed to honor my potential in life. 

 

Only
near the end of my junior year at UCSC did I begin to fully understand why I chose
to return to college. I found myself in near-identical circumstances, with the
only variable being 30 years of life experience. The contrast in my responses
and relationship to my college experience solidified my nonsensical circular path, and suddenly--right before my eyes!--there appeared a diamond. It was as if the entire universe humbled itself to offer this perfect, clear jewel of unending brilliance no matter the angle. Life was always trying to do that, even--and especially!--in those periods when I was full of fear and self doubt. How could one not cherish ALL of this, every single moment? 

This is a true story! The fallen leaves of my
goals were now radiant, with astonishing and nuanced features and colors. The stresses and
insecurities arose just as before, but I didn’t feel compelled to act on them
or conclude anything about myself from them. I was too fascinated with the beauty of this diamond and couldn't get over how grateful I was. "Excuse me, but are you sure you delivered to the right address? Really, this life is for little, unremarkable me?" Learning science was, at times like listening to a transcendent musical
composition or fully experiencing, with all 27 trillion cells at once enamored by an ineffably beautiful painting or poem. "Was it possible to die from astonishment!?," I sometimes feared and giggled about. And you don't have to pay money for this--it's totally free! And there's ALWAYS more....


 

As a graduate student, I discovered
another aspect of grateful curiosity--durable fulfillment. I find science very difficult to learn. Most of the time, I'm in a state of frustration and confusion. I've grown comfortable with feeling like the dumbest person in the room. I'm telling you--it is great to not have that pressure of being correct all of the time! It's fun to make educated guesses and get playfully challenged. At first, it's scary to make a statement when you don't know, but then it becomes exhilarating! It's thrilling to push into the unknown! And to experience that thrill, one has to be perpetually stupid and confused. That's where the fun happens--the play, the creativity. The frustration of losing over and over--just for that chance of reporting something original! That's what got me hooked on research, and willing to ante up all of my waking energy on that possibility. I believe that, in terms of career, that's the ultimate fulfillment as a scientist--win or lose (A draw indicates a half-hearted decision, and I've developed a strong distaste for those). 

As an individual human, the fulfillment is in the path itself. To me, fulfillment is an outcome of transformative growth--a process of aligning with, discovering, and expressing more and more of who we truly are. That's all. Just that. The feedback comes from only from the quality of our relationships with one another, and what we leave behind us in those interactions, no matter how fleeting or enduring. Every single interaction we have matters profoundly--and nothing is more powerful than even the smallest gesture of care or kindness offered to another. Just a fleeting look into the eyes can communicate everything between the truest parts of ourselves--all at once, everything.

Who I am and what I do are inseparable, yet they seem to become even more inseparable as I trot along. By nature, I'm an artistic type. My research and my analytical processes flow primarily from that creative space, and I see the beauty taking shape not so much in the outcome, but in the approach, the process, the thinking. The foundational philosophical questions--who am I and how shall I live-- harmonize perfectly with the mysteries that beckon from the neural assemblies in the brain, which give rise to the entire experience of being human. As a researcher, my goal is to see clearly, to examine from multiple angles. And indeed, I've never seen it, but if I had to describe what "perfect" research looks like: my diamond. Elegant, perhaps a with bell-like clarity. You see the figure and it stuns you with a humble kind of power and simplicity.

My story is no less extraordinary and magical than you who are reading this. Our stories are, in fact, critical parts of the human story. I don't even know who you are, yet I'm somehow fascinated by you and want to know your story, your vision--who you are and your relationship to life. We're writing this story together, why not get on board with it, get nuts with it, find out what is actually possible? I love this idea of emergent properties, not only as a biological theory, but also between people who come together out of sincere curiosity. It's everywhere in nature, so why should it be different between two or more humans? Everything from galaxies to atoms has this one thing in common, emergence of novelty. Transcend and include; transcend and include--from the smallest particle to the atom to the molecule, ...., to the human. This is my vision for scientific advancement: true collaboration. Are you ready? Let's go!
