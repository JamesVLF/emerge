There's something beautifully recursive about using neural networks (the biological kind in my brain) to study neural networks (the computational kind in my models) to understand neural networks (the literal ones growing in organoids on my bench).

Each layer of abstraction is really just pattern recognition—synapses firing in response to statistical regularities, whether those regularities are in spike trains, correlation matrices, or the rhythm of a conversation.

The danger, though, is that our brains are *too* good at finding patterns. We see faces in clouds, meaning in randomness, causation in correlation. It's why we need statistics, why we need controls, why we need to constantly check our assumptions.

But it's also why we *can* do science at all. Our pattern-hungry brains drive us to ask "why?" when we notice something unexpected. The burst firing that doesn't quite match the model. The organoid that behaves differently. The result that makes you stop and think.

The trick is staying curious enough to notice the patterns, but skeptical enough to test them.
