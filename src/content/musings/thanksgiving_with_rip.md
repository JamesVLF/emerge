"Cheese is weird because it reaks like homeless person--and the more it smells like homeless crotch, the more delicious it is!

This realization happened when I opened up the gorgonzola on Thanksgiving....and...I thought it was because the homeless guy's odor molecules--shit particles, gooch oils, noxious fumes and gasses, the mounds of tarter over his rotten teeth and gums, all of it totally inevitable due to the Second Law of Thermodynamics--but the binding energy of that FILTH to the olfactory receptors was....it was incomprehsibly shocking in its capacity to disgust me!

I felt truly the victim of extreme violence--the uncategorized compounds viciously pounding and pounding on my nostrils. I was about to puke right on the Thanksgiving table...but then i realized...it's not the homeless guy I'm smelling--it's the cheese!! Instantly, the vomit reflex transformed into a thousand lawn sprinklers in my mouth (I'm referring to my salivary glands here, metaphorically, you know). And I was so shocked by this paradox that the cracker and cheese detached from my tongue and fell right out of my mouth.

And this motherfucker...he was torturing me because they were out of 64.9 oz pepsi bottles…the store only carried the Pepsi in 64.8 oz bottles--and this was totally unacceptable to him!

How did I end up doing this homeless guy's bidding--being his goddamned butler--in the first place? I made eye contact with him and then i had to do whatever he asked…I hooked his ass up too! He got himself some nice cigars...the long, thin ones with the cherry flavor.

Well after the soda issue was negotiated (it was not on issue of flavor to him, but it was the flavor to volume ratio, you see...and that 0.1 oz difference just made the Pepsi tantamount to a pile of shit, so Dr. Pepper was the obvious and only choice--so he conceded to drinking the 64 oz doctor pepper. He got angry because I didn't thank him for helping me out by agreeing to drink the totally unappetizing number of ounces... which helped me out like you wouldn't believe!) we moved over to the snack area….I had to help him locate corn chips (he was handing me Cheetos, pretzels, everything…asking me if it was plain corn chips). Then after 15/20 min, I handed the nice cashiers a 20 and said to just give him the change…he was still dragging his ass through the aisles talking to himself…..

then he went to the counter and they told him he has 20 bucks to play with and he started demanding the cigars from behind the shelf. He smelled so fucking bad….it hit you like smelling salts or ammonia. He's a human being, though….and it's my favorite thing to be able to do that, so I was grateful that he shuffled up to me.

Just sayin….he smelled like aged gorgonzola…he should probably take a knife and shave some off his feet and eat it on a cracker like I did. It'll probably taste even better than my gorgonzola. I might even go back there with a cheese grater when I need to top off my spaghetti--I'll pay him another 20 bucks to hand over his foot for a few shavings."

Amazing how he grew so demanding…ordering the two cashiers around….when he learned he had 20 bucks in 7/11 store credit to play with....

Anyway, while he was ordering those two suckers around, I siezed the moment and slid out the door....I saw him coming out the door and i immediately hit the gas!"
