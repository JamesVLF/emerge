I used to have a superstitious belief that some vague abstraction of sorts--not ME-- was responsible for where I happened to be at a particular moment in life. "They created this feeling in me"--anger or self-pity or whatever. And you think that rush of emotion that compels you to act out in a certain way IS you! That, in a sense, you "have no choice." But you do, and you know it, just like I knew it all along! You'll deny it and pretend that you can't see it. You'll look everywhere for exceptions, for some compromise, because the absolute nature of what I'm suggesting--that we ourselves are 100% responsible all of the time for everything in our experience--is absolutely terrifying, isn't it? It can't be true, can it!? It sounds insane, doesn't it? 

That illusion got torched when I was around 22. When I say torched, I mean that it was like when you wake up from a dream and you touch your skin. You slap yourself to be 100% sure it was only a dream (I never needed to SLAP myself to know whether I'm still sleeping, so I'm not sure why you do that). You weren't really standing in front of the auditorium delivering your dissertation to those frowning, crooked-mouthed faces. But you could clearly see and experience their outrage toward you, couldn't you? They were in a state of stunned disgust by the incoherent animal noises coming out of your flapping gums and tongue. Their anger was justified--held captive while stupidity ejected out of your lips onto their confused faces. How dare you violate the second law! "Oh what an amazing freak showcased here," they wheezed with laughter. 

In the first or second year, you were somehow able to catch yourself before you went out the door with no pants. Your luck ran out this time, didn't it? Everyone in the audience should understand, since they were once in your shoes. But you forgot those too, and now your ankle-high black socks are revealed, looking even more ridiculous next to the white underwear. In truth, forgetting your pants is totally understandable, and everyone laughing at you once forgot their pants too! Those are your socks they're not standing in and that's their chair your ass isn't sitting in. 

Even in the dream, a part of you knows you are only dreaming. It's not enjoying this dream, so it says "wake up and take a pee, so you can go back and try another dream, a better dream." You waddle to the toilet wearing your stupid underwear and thin black socks, still unable to shake the residual feelings of humiliation or get the laughs out of your ears as you hunch over the toilet for the last couple of dribbles.  

Once your parents told you that Santa Claus was not real, but were you instantly convinced? Slowly you put the pieces together and it made sense. Once it made sense, and you admitted to yourself that it made sense, THAT is when you could no longer believe it. You could no longer be amused at the little game every year, all the cookies and milk bullshit--what a sham! How did you buy into that?  

But maybe you still fantasize and wish you could go back to the state of believing in jolly ol' Saint Nick. You'd entice him over with some cheap oatmeal cookies, and in exchange, you'd receive the latest iPhone (which has the extra pixel or dumb color). Just picture it: out of his sack, he'd pull your salvation. There you could dunk your awareness deep into the warm oasis of "tiktoks" and duck-faced selfies, drool hanging out of the corner of your mouth as you walk through traffic. You'd be free, oblivious as you shuffle in front of the 4,000 pound missile I command, revving and honking at you to wake up! 

I'm sure a small part of you wishes Santa was real. I still do. Well not really, because it's kind of creepy when you think about how he's obsessing over you all year, waiting for that key moment to visit. It's Christmas Eve, and you're under your covers, relaxed and nearly asleep. And there he is watching you (his expression looks exactly like yours in front of the iPhone when you cross the street the moment I hit the gas) at the edge of the chimney with anticipation. Any second now, you could cross that critical threshold into unconsciousness (just a hair away from your ordinary somnambulic state, missiles yielding and swerving to accommodate your mindless shuffling and tiktoking through traffic). Santa is right there, ass over the chimney, goofy orgasm face, waiting for that magic moment to arrive. Only then will he invade your home, drink milk from the glass, and leave crumbs all over the table. Then it all happens again year after year, all on its own. And you take part, even though I'll bet you find it dreadfully boring and silly, don't you! It's fun for sure, but it also feels very superficial and pointless with the decorations and sales and all of that coming out in September.

I used to feel overwhelmed by my emotions, pushing me to do one thing or another. Even the word "overwhelmed" insinuates that some outside wind blew me helplessly to do something. It can feel that way, but it's only a matter of perspective. It starts with a knowing of a potential for beauty in you. That's you, and you acknowledge that it's you. By consequence, you know that the "thing that overwhelms" is NOT you. And there began the process of becoming more and more of myself. Dark nights of the soul (resulting from my failures of decision) became the catalysts for greater alignment. The will to not betray myself grew stronger, more and more immovable over time. Why would I ever choose to move and become something that I don't want. I want to be me. Why would I not want to be me? 

Over many years, I found that compulsions that were once overwhelming seemed like a puff of air against my cheek. Poof and gone. No lingering, no pressure buildup. It's amazing. That's how it always was. There was always a choice; my relationship to every circumstance in my life and the choices that I made from those timepoints were every time 100% volitional. It was just a matter of focus and perspective, a momentum that was redirected toward something I wanted more. That's it. Then, it all just happens. 

After a while, the external catalysts stopped because of my choices. I had no more chaos and drama. Then I started to direct myself, choose my own catalysts, grow in whatever direction I chose. And that is what brought me here. To know that my response to every circumstance I'm in from moment to moment is entirely in my control is frightening only to the part of myself that waits for Santa, that doesn't want to grow up, that doesn't want to be responsible. But freedom is responsibility! Being responsible means anything you choose is possible--anything. And when you know that life is good, you fear nothing about this infinite potential. You want to immerse yourself always into that, become that which is yourself. And that is when the goodies get delivered for real!
