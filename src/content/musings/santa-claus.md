I used to have a superstitious belief that some vague abstraction of sorts was partially responsible for where I happened to be at a particular moment in life, but that illusion got torched when I was around 22. When I say torched, I mean that it was like when you wake up from a dream and you touch your skin. You know you were only dreaming that you were standing in front of the auditorium delivering your dissertation to those frowning, crooked-mouthed faces. They were stunned--disgusted--by the noises coming out of your flapping gums and tongue. Their anger was justified--held captive while stupidity ejected out of your lips onto their confused faces. How dare you violate the second law! "Oh what an amazing freak showcased here," they wheezed.

You are a PhD student--busy, late all the time, scrambling for dear life in a panic. Other times, you caught yourself before you went out the door, but your luck ran and this time you left without pants. Understandable, but that makes it no less humiliating. Everyone laughed, beholding the real you regaled in white underwear and black socks. Even in the dream a part of you knows it is a dream, and this is confirmed when you wake up (wearing your stupid underwear and thin black socks in bed); but you still feel humiliated (as you should), even while knowing it was only a dream (yet, there you are in your underwear, which is also corroded with holes and long toenails protruding). 

Once your parents told you that Santa Claus was not real, I'll bet you still believed it for a long time. But eventually, you got the point where you couldn't believe anymore. But you still wished, didn't you? You'd entice him over with some cheap oatmeal cookies, and in exchange, you'd receive the latest iPhone (which has the extra pixel you need). Just picture it: out of his sack, he'd pull your salvation. There you could dunk your awareness deep into the warm oasis of "tiktoks" and duck-faced selfies, drool hanging out of the corner of your mouth as you walk through traffic. You'd be free, oblivious as you shuffle in front of the 4,000 pound missile I command, revving and honking at you.

I'm sure you wish Santa was real. I still do. Well not really, because it's kind of creepy when you think about how he's obsessing over you all year, waiting for that key moment to visit. It's Christmas Eve, and you're under your covers, relaxed and nearly asleep. And there he is watching you (his expression looks exactly like yours in front of the iPhone when you cross the street the moment I hit the gas) at the edge of the chimney with anticipation. Any second now, you could cross that critical threshold into unconsciousness (not far from your normal state, except now you're horizontal and wearing a Fruit of the Loom elastic band round your waist. The rest of it must have evaporated over the years. That's my theory.). Santa is right there, ass over the chimney, goofy orgasm face, waiting for that magic moment to arrive. 

Only then will he invade your home, drink milk from the glass, and leave crumbs all over the table. Did you know that only psychopaths drink milk from a glass, and that's why you had it in the first place. Don't drink that in front of me, at least not from the glass. I don't want to see the cloudy thick substance coating the glass or the Hitler mustache as you stare at me. I do giggle and feel quite superior, knowing that it came from udders hanging like a psychotic balloon.
